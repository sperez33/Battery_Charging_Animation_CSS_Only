# Battery_Charging_Animation_CSS_Only
A little project my manager at RSI gave me to work on to improve my CSS skills.

June.20.2019 - 2:19p - added an absolute position attribute to the DIV that holds my images. No animations yet but I did 
get the images perfectly overlapped using position, top, left, transform: translate, and the z-index. I also Added in 
position, top, left, transform: translate, and animation into .charging in the CSS. I entered in the entire block of 
.charging:before for when I add in the animation.
